## Technologies used
The game was developed using Java programming language and SQL database for storing user preferences and game data. The Object-Oriented Programming principles were employed throughout the development process. The design patterns used in the project include:
-Singleton pattern for creating a single instance of the hero.
-Factory pattern for creating and returning a tile object with the corresponding ID.
The game's architecture was modeled using UML diagrams.

## Features
* Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
* Enemies with unique characteristics
* Diamondsd and power-ups that boost the hero's abilities
* User preferences stored in a SQL database
* Ability to save and load the game
* Exception handling for empty or invalid map files and unknown tiles
